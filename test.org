* noun

  1. a unit of language, consisting of one or more spoken sounds or
     their written representation, that functions as a principal
     carrier of meaning. Words are composed of one or more morphemes
     and are either the smallest units susceptible of independent use
     or consist of two or three such units combined under certain
     linking conditions, as with the loss of primary accent that
     distinguishes black·bird· from blacbird. Words are usually
     separated by spaces in writing, and are distinguished
     phonologically, as by accent, in many languages.

  2. (used in combination with the first letter of an offensive or
     unmentionable word, the first letter being lowercase or
     uppercase, with or without a following hyphen):

     /My mom married at 20, and she mentions the m-word every time I
     meet someone she thinks is eligible./

     See also *f-word*, *n-word*.

  3. words
     1. speech or talk: to express one's emotion in words;
	/Words mean little when action is called for./

     2. the text or lyrics of a song as distinguished from the music.

     3. contentious or angry speech; a quarrel:
	/We had words and she walked out on me./

  4. a short talk or conversation:
     /Marston, I'd like a word with you./

  5. an expression or utterance:
     /a word of warning./

  6. warrant, assurance, or promise:
     /I give you my word I'll be there./

  7. news; tidings; information:
     /We received word of his death./

  3. *eat one's words*, to retract one's statement, especially with humility:
